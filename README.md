# Quora-Insincere-Question-calssification
This is the project that I Worked on during In-class competition held in my Machine learning Course  

Note- 
Please use python version 3.7.6 (as it was in kaggle) because of the usage of f string and all.

Two submission on which final scoring was done is

1> (name of the submission) submission_my_real1.csv -> score 0.63633 (best) (Which is seen on leader board)

	

best_score.py		(Without stemming)
vis.py			(For EDA)


About code->

-Please change the paths in data loading section and also submission file is loaded in the end of each script so please change the path there

-this scripts were tested on kaggle.

-Code also has print statements so when running it will show different process that are performed.

How to run and what to run

To reproduce 1 run the script best_score.py -> it will produce the submission file best_score.csv

To produce the EDA part which was mentioned in report and presentation run vis.py
